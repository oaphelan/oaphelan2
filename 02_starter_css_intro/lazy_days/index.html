    <h3>By Susan Smith</h3>
    <img scr="lazy_days/images/diner.jpg" alt="diner">
    <p>As my New Year's Resolution in 2016, I vowed to never again make a meal at home. I found that cooking meals at home took time and effort, and the food never seemed to measure up to the greasy good that is readily available at any old diner.

  <h4>THE ART OF DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING</h4>
  <h5>By Jose Perez</h5>
  <img scr="images/beach.jpg" alt="beach">
  <p>Is your job taking too much time away from your rest and relaxation? Does your algebra homework keep you up at night?
